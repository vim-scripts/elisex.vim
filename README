A pinky-yellowy-greeny colorscheme inspired on a popular
classical composition of "Ludwig van Beethoven", called
"FÃ¼r Elise" (For Elise). 

This one uses bold and italic font styles to please your eyes.

If you aren't scarred by _Pink_ comments, you'll LOVE this scheme.

Note: - Only standard (for all languages) highlight-groups are set.
      - This colorscheme _should_ look nice everywhere.
